Pressure Plate Demo

This repository showcases a pressure plate mechanism implemented in both Blueprints and C++ within Unreal Engine 5. The project was inspired by Ali Zohery's Unreal Engine Blueprint to C++ tutorial
, which demonstrates the process of converting gameplay logic from visual scripting to C++ code.

Project Overview

The demo features:

Pressure Plate Actor: Detects player interaction and triggers events.

Door Actor: Opens and closes in response to pressure plate activation.

Player Character: Interacts with the pressure plate to control the door.

Learning Outcomes:

Through this project, I have gained:

Understanding of Unreal Engine's component-based architecture.

Experience in translating Blueprint logic to C++.

Insights into handling actor interactions and event-driven programming.

Knowledge of optimizing gameplay elements for performance and maintainability.
